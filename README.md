# 🌐 Flowweave

**Drag. Connect. Automate. — The No-Code Automation Platform for Web2 and Web3.**

---

## Overview

**Flowweave** is a no-code automation platform where users can easily create, customize, and deploy automated workflows by dragging and connecting blocks on a visual grid.  
Designed for the decentralized era, Flowweave ensures that every automation is stored permanently and verifiably on **Arweave**, making them tamper-proof, transparent, and unstoppable.

Whether you're automating Web2 apps, interacting with Web3 smart contracts, or combining both worlds, Flowweave lets you build powerful workflows without writing a single line of code.
